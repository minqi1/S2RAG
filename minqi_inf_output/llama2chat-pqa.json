In 1930 he founded the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union. He popularised the area's coffee production, and was given the title Wasaoye-o-Wachagga (Elder of the Chagga). He noticed that, in Chagga society, care of the furrows was a prime social duty. If a furrow was damaged, even accidentally, one of the elders would sound a horn in the evening (which was known as the call to the furrows). The next morning, townspeople would leave their normal work and set about the business of repairing the damaged furrow. Dundas became very popular and respected during his stay at Moshi. When he left Moshi for the last time by train to Tanga and ship to Dar es Salaam, the Chagga reputedly hired a band to accompany him on board the ship and serenade him on his journey. As the boat sailed into Dar es Salaam harbour, the band apparently struck up God Save the King. Later on, Dundas was Governor of the Bahamas for eight years, to be replaced by the Duke of Windsor. Dundas then became Governor of Uganda.

If a furrow was damaged, even accidentally, one of the elders would sound a horn in the evening (which was known as the call to the furrows). The next morning, townspeople would leave their normal work and set about the business of repairing the damaged furrow. Dundas became very popular and respected during his stay at Moshi.

Kyriakos Pittakis campaigned to collect epigraphical material in Athens, gathering inscriptions in the church of Megali Panagia, the Theseum, the Stoa of Hadrian and the Tower of the Winds.

In 1824, he left for Corfu, where he studied in the Ionian Academy. After independence, Pittakis became Greece's first General Keeper of Antiquities. From 1837 to 1840, Pittakis supervised the reassembly of the Erechtheion. Though well-intentioned, his ignorance drew criticism from architecture historians and archaeologists. Kyriakos Pittakis campaigned to collect epigraphical material in Athens, gathering inscriptions in the church of Megali Panagia, the Theseum, the Stoa of Hadrian and the Tower of the Winds. Such preservationary efforts have been considered significant contributions to Greek archaeology. He also carried out the first excavations at Mycenae in 1841.

Myers taught at Kent State University in the art department beginning in 1964 and is particularly known for his 1970 film Confrontation at Kent State, which he filmed in Kent during the week following the Kent State shootings of May 4, 1970; it is an important document of the period. Myers began to produce independent films in the early 1960s. Many of his films are highly personal, with non-narrative or loose narrative structures derived from his dreams. Although some films (as, for example, his 1993 film Tarp) feature no actors at all, instead focusing entirely on inanimate objects, most films feature nonprofessional actors and are produced on very small budgets. Myers is the recipient of two (due to a name spelling error) Guggenheim Fellowships as well as grants from the American Film Institute and the National Endowment for the Arts.
